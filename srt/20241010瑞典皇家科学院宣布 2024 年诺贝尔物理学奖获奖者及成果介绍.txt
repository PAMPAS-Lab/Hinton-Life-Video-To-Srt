1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:07,421
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Welcome to this press conference and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences where we will present this year's Nobel Prize in Physics.

2
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:19,557
Speaker SPEAKER_09: We will keep to our tradition and begin the presentation in Swedish and then continue in English and you are of course welcome to ask questions in either language later on.

3
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:23,266
Speaker SPEAKER_09: My name is Hans Ellergren.

4
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:27,150
Speaker SPEAKER_09: I'm the Secretary General of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

5
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:34,499
Speaker SPEAKER_09: And to my right is Professor Ellen Mons, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics.

6
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:42,127
Speaker SPEAKER_09: And to my left is Professor Anders Yderbeck, member of the Nobel Committee in Physics and expert in this field.

7
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,034
Speaker SPEAKER_09: This year's prize is about machines that learn.

8
00:00:54,335 --> 00:01:20,545
Speaker SPEAKER_09: The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has today decided to award the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics to John Hopfield, Princeton University, USA, and Geoffrey Hinton, University of Toronto, Canada, for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.

9
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:26,177
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Professor Ellen Moons will now give us a short summary of the prize.

10
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:27,179
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Please.

11
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:28,921
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Thank you.

12
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:35,349
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Learning is a fascinating ability of the human brain.

13
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:42,778
Speaker SPEAKER_01: We can recognize images and speech and associate them with memories and past experiences.

14
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:49,266
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Billions of neurons wired together give us unique cognitive abilities.

15
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:57,709
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Artificial neural networks are inspired by this network of neurons in our brains.

16
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:06,444
Speaker SPEAKER_01: This year's laureates for the Nobel Prize in Physics, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton,

17
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:24,534
Speaker SPEAKER_01: used fundamental concepts from statistical physics to design artificial neural networks that function as associative memories and find patterns in large data sets.

18
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:37,332
Speaker SPEAKER_01: These artificial neural networks have been used to advance research across physics topics as diverse as particle physics, material science, and astrophysics.

19
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:41,258
Speaker SPEAKER_01: They have also become part of our daily lives.

20
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:46,506
Speaker SPEAKER_01: For instance, in facial recognition and language translation.

21
00:02:46,957 --> 00:03:05,068
Speaker SPEAKER_01: The laureates' discoveries and inventions form the building blocks of machine learning that can aid humans in making faster and more reliable decisions, for instance, when diagnosing medical conditions.

22
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:16,889
Speaker SPEAKER_01: However, while machine learning has enormous benefits, its rapid development has also raised concerns about our future.

23
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:31,747
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Collectively, humans carry the responsibility for using this new technology in a safe and ethical way, for the greatest benefit of humankind.

24
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:34,330
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Thank you.

25
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:38,002
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Professor Ebeck, are you ready to give a more detailed presentation?

26
00:03:38,947 --> 00:03:39,146
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Thank you.

27
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:39,468
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Please.

28
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:46,092
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Yeah.

29
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:52,536
Speaker SPEAKER_10: So this year's Nobel Prize in physics is about artificial neural networks.

30
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,171
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Today we know that this is a powerful computational approach.

31
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:04,485
Speaker SPEAKER_10: This was not evident 50 years ago.

32
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:17,057
Speaker SPEAKER_10: But it was known that we mammals are very good at pattern recognition by some sort of computation in our brains.

33
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:33,612
Speaker SPEAKER_10: And this sparked an interest in understanding the collective properties of networks of simplified neurons

34
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:44,228
Speaker SPEAKER_10: connected by couplings with a strength that could become weaker or that could become stronger.

35
00:04:44,810 --> 00:05:01,235
Speaker SPEAKER_10: And the idea would then be to determine the strength of the couplings to achieve a certain function and doing that by training the network on many examples.

36
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:38,732
Speaker SPEAKER_10: A net breakthrough came in 1982 when John Hopfield presented a dynamic network which could store and retrieve memories, associative memories.

37
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:45,665
Speaker SPEAKER_10: The memory had simple binary 01 nodes, all nodes connected, pairwise connected.

38
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:56,146
Speaker SPEAKER_10: The states that remained unchanged with time were identified as memories.

39
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:10,262
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Moreover, it was possible to introduce an energy similar to energies one has in studying magnetic systems in physics.

40
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:18,995
Speaker SPEAKER_10: And that energy had the property that it was low in the states corresponding to memories.

41
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:32,648
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Metaphorically, the memories were located in valleys of an energy landscape.

42
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:49,005
Speaker SPEAKER_10: When starting from a distorted pattern with higher energy, the network would slide down in energy to a nearby valley.

43
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:59,800
Speaker SPEAKER_10: And by this process, the distorted pattern could be corrected.

44
00:07:04,976 --> 00:07:25,077
Speaker SPEAKER_10: In follow-up work, John Hopfield also showed that this network was robust in the sense that the binary nodes could be replaced with analog ones, and he also showed how the network could be used to solve difficult optimization problems.

45
00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:44,416
Speaker SPEAKER_10: The creation and explorations of this network by John Holm Hopfield was a milestone in our understanding of the computational abilities of artificial neural networks.

46
00:07:50,336 --> 00:08:01,355
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Another important discovery came soon afterwards by Geoffrey Hinton and Terence Sienopski.

47
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:14,016
Speaker SPEAKER_10: They created a stochastic version of the Hopfield network based on statistical physics and called the Boltzmann machine.

48
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:25,076
Speaker SPEAKER_10: So here, the focus is on statistical distributions of patents rather than individual patents.

49
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:29,583
Speaker SPEAKER_10: It is a generative model.

50
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:37,471
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Once trained, it can be used to generate new instances from the learned distribution.

51
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:47,734
Speaker SPEAKER_10: It had the same basic structure as Hopfield's network, but there were two types of nodes, hidden and visible ones.

52
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:55,090
Speaker SPEAKER_10: And the hidden nodes were there to make it possible for the network to learn more general distributions.

53
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:06,860
Speaker SPEAKER_10: So, while theoretically interesting, in practice, the Boltzmann machine was initially of limited use.

54
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,264
Speaker SPEAKER_10: It was prohibitively demanding computationally.

55
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:26,460
Speaker SPEAKER_10: However, a version with fewer couplings called the restricted Boltzmann machine developed into a versatile tool, and I will soon mention it again.

56
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:37,701
Speaker SPEAKER_10: So far I talked about recurrent networks with feedback connections.

57
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:52,278
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Many of today's deep learning methods involve feed-forward networks where information flow from an input layer to an output layer via hidden layers.

58
00:09:52,259 --> 00:10:08,486
Speaker SPEAKER_10: In the 1980s, Hinton showed how such a network with hidden layers could be trained.

59
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:16,782
Speaker SPEAKER_10: And in that process, he also elucidated the important function of hidden layers.

60
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:31,609
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Then in the 1990s, there were applications of multi-layer networks, successful applications, for example, for the classification of handwritten digits.

61
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:42,346
Speaker SPEAKER_10: But the networks that one could train had relatively few couplings between consecutive layers.

62
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:54,177
Speaker SPEAKER_10: It remained a challenge to train more general deep structures with high connectivity between the layers.

63
00:10:56,283 --> 00:11:01,371
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Here, in fact, Manny gave up, but Hinton did not.

64
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:09,164
Speaker SPEAKER_10: And Hinton overcame this barrier by using this restricted Boltzmann machine.

65
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:17,919
Speaker SPEAKER_10: He used it to pre-train deep structures, and by this method,

66
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:29,697
Speaker SPEAKER_10: He succeeded in implementing examples of deep and dense structures, which was a breakthrough toward deep learning.

67
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:55,461
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Finally, so now I have talked about physics, how physics has been a driving force behind innovation and development in artificial neural network.

68
00:11:55,961 --> 00:12:06,856
Speaker SPEAKER_10: It's also interesting to see how physics as a research field is benefiting from these methods.

69
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:18,259
Speaker SPEAKER_10: And one example, well-established example here is data analysis in particle physics and astrophysics.

70
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:29,200
Speaker SPEAKER_10: An increasingly important application is in modeling materials.

71
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:37,130
Speaker SPEAKER_10: For example, to search for novel, more efficient solar cells.

72
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:49,246
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Yet another example is in explicit physics-based climate modeling to enable higher resolution.

73
00:12:51,927 --> 00:13:07,321
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Finally, I want to mention two successful applications outside the physics area, protein structure prediction and analysis of medical images.

74
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:11,590
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Thank you for your attention.

75
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,322
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Thank you, Professor Irbeck.

76
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:22,091
Speaker SPEAKER_09: I think we might have John Hopfield or Jeff Hinton with us on the phone.

77
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,716
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Good morning, Professor Hinton.

78
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:28,078
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Good morning.

79
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,485
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Please accept our warmest congratulations to receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics.

80
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,589
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Thank you very much.

81
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:37,610
Speaker SPEAKER_09: How do you feel right now?

82
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,649
Speaker SPEAKER_02: I'm flabbergasted.

83
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,591
Speaker SPEAKER_02: I had no idea this would happen.

84
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:45,673
Speaker SPEAKER_02: I'm very surprised.

85
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:48,836
Speaker SPEAKER_09: I could imagine.

86
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:56,263
Speaker SPEAKER_09: I'm sitting here in this beautiful session hall of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences here at the press conference.

87
00:13:56,543 --> 00:14:01,488
Speaker SPEAKER_09: There are many interested journalists from both the Swedish and the international press.

88
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,831
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Would you be ready to take some questions from them?

89
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:06,972
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Yes.

90
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:10,369
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Yes, please.

91
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:11,230
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Sveriges Television.

92
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,552
Speaker SPEAKER_04: Thank you.

93
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:18,779
Speaker SPEAKER_04: My warmest congratulations to your achievements and to this year's Nobel Prize in Physics.

94
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:25,008
Speaker SPEAKER_04: My name is Susan Ritzen and my question comes from Swedish television.

95
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:32,116
Speaker SPEAKER_04: I know many of our viewers, also lay people, are very curious about the discoveries awarded here today.

96
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:45,778
Speaker SPEAKER_04: I wonder, do you remember when you realized your breakthrough, awarded today, if you can bring us back in time briefly, and what were the reasons for, or the inspiration for these revelations?

97
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:55,352
Speaker SPEAKER_02: So, I remember a couple of occasions with two of my mentors.

98
00:14:56,053 --> 00:15:00,179
Speaker SPEAKER_02: So I have an enormous debt to David Rommelhart and Terry Sanofsky,

99
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:12,230
Speaker SPEAKER_02: With David Remelhardt, we rediscovered the back propagation algorithm, and that was in the beginning of 1982.

100
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:22,863
Speaker SPEAKER_02: And with Terry Sinofsky, Terry and I discovered a learning algorithm for Hopfield nets that had hidden units.

101
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:29,390
Speaker SPEAKER_02: And I remember very well going to a meeting in Rochester

102
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:31,826
Speaker SPEAKER_02: where John Hopfield talked.

103
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:40,856
Speaker SPEAKER_02: And I first learned about the Hopfield energy function for neural networks.

104
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:50,846
Speaker SPEAKER_02: And after that, Terry and I worked previously on how to generalize neural networks to have hidden units.

105
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:58,956
Speaker SPEAKER_02: And at the beginning of 1982, we came up with a learning algorithm.

106
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:04,361
Speaker SPEAKER_02: for Baltimore Machines which are hot field nets with hidden units.

107
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:13,299
Speaker SPEAKER_02: So the most exciting times were with David Rammelhart on back propagation and Terry Sinofsky on Baltimore Machines.

108
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:16,767
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Thank you.

109
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:18,269
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Okay, more questions.

110
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:21,736
Speaker SPEAKER_09: First here.

111
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:26,375
Speaker SPEAKER_00: Hello, Bogumił Radajewski from the Polish television.

112
00:16:26,495 --> 00:16:27,177
Speaker SPEAKER_00: Congratulations.

113
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:36,450
Speaker SPEAKER_00: The question I have is a little bit about the future because obviously we are very excited about what neural networks and machine learning can do now.

114
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:42,979
Speaker SPEAKER_00: But what we're even more excited is the prospect of what they could do in the future.

115
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:52,972
Speaker SPEAKER_00: What are your predictions about the degree of influence that this technology is going to have on our civilization?

116
00:16:54,774 --> 00:16:56,677
Speaker SPEAKER_02: I think it will have a huge influence.

117
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:59,038
Speaker SPEAKER_02: It will be comparable with the Industrial Revolution.

118
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:06,385
Speaker SPEAKER_02: But instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it's going to exceed people in intellectual ability.

119
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:11,790
Speaker SPEAKER_02: We have no experience of what it's like to have things smarter than us.

120
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:16,556
Speaker SPEAKER_02: And it's going to be wonderful in many respects.

121
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:22,281
Speaker SPEAKER_02: In areas like health care, it's going to give us much better health care in almost all interests.

122
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:23,803
Speaker SPEAKER_02: It's going to make them more efficient.

123
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:29,924
Speaker SPEAKER_02: people are going to be able to do the same amount of work with an AI assistant in much less time.

124
00:17:29,984 --> 00:17:45,124
Speaker SPEAKER_02: It'll mean huge improvements in productivity, but we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.

125
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:50,230
Speaker SPEAKER_09: I think first we have here and then there.

126
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:55,828
Speaker SPEAKER_07: Hi, Simon Campanello with Dagens Nyheter.

127
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,070
Speaker SPEAKER_07: Congratulations on the prize.

128
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:11,400
Speaker SPEAKER_07: My question is, last year you said in an interview with New York Times that you regret part of your life's work because of the risks with artificial intelligence.

129
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,904
Speaker SPEAKER_07: How do you feel about today?

130
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:42,930
Speaker SPEAKER_02: um there's two kinds of regret there's regrets where you feel guilty because you did something you knew you shouldn't have done and then there's regret where you did something that you would do again in the same circumstances but it may in the end not turn out well um i that second kind of regret i have in the same circumstances i would do the same again but i am worried that the overall consequence of this might be um

131
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:46,422
Speaker SPEAKER_02: systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control.

132
00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:50,406
Speaker SPEAKER_08: Yes, please.

133
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:57,155
Speaker SPEAKER_03: Hi, congratulations on the prize.

134
00:18:57,215 --> 00:19:05,166
Speaker SPEAKER_03: My name is Anna-Louise Meigner-Arn and I'm from TV4, a Swedish TV channel.

135
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:12,276
Speaker SPEAKER_03: I would like to know, you developed this Boltzmann machine and

136
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:39,359
Speaker SPEAKER_03: I wonder what type of AI has come out of it, like GPT, or how you see breast cancer in x-rays, or how you make funny

137
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:51,865
Speaker SPEAKER_03: pictures in Dali, what kind of AI do your research, do build on your research?

138
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:55,190
Speaker SPEAKER_02: So there were two different learning algorithms I was involved in.

139
00:19:55,789 --> 00:20:00,355
Speaker SPEAKER_02: One was the Boltzmann machine, which was a learning algorithm for Hopfield nets with hidden units.

140
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:07,643
Speaker SPEAKER_02: And we did eventually find a practical version of that, but that's not what's led to the

141
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,330
Speaker SPEAKER_02: main progress currently in neural nets.

142
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:13,574
Speaker SPEAKER_02: That's the backpropagation algorithm.

143
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:20,701
Speaker SPEAKER_02: And this is a way to get a neural net to learn anything.

144
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:34,355
Speaker SPEAKER_02: And it's the backpropagation algorithm that's led to the huge surge in AI applications and in the ability to recognize images and understand speech and to deal with natural language.

145
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:41,863
Speaker SPEAKER_02: It's not the Boltzmann machine that did that, it's the backpropagation algorithm.

146
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:42,903
Speaker SPEAKER_09: More questions?

147
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:50,891
Speaker SPEAKER_06: Yeah, one here, please.

148
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:52,113
Speaker SPEAKER_06: Hi, my name is Bill.

149
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,714
Speaker SPEAKER_06: I'm from the Swedish paper Nyteknik.

150
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:58,519
Speaker SPEAKER_06: Do you have any favorite AI tool that you use?

151
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:05,305
Speaker SPEAKER_02: I actually use GPT-4 quite a lot.

152
00:21:05,757 --> 00:21:10,305
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Whenever I want to know the answer to anything, I just go and ask GPT-4.

153
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:21,002
Speaker SPEAKER_02: I don't totally trust it because it can hallucinate, but on almost everything, it's a not very good expert, and that's very useful.

154
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,230
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Okay.

155
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,135
Speaker SPEAKER_09: I don't see any more.

156
00:21:29,576 --> 00:21:31,359
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Is there one more hand there, please, in the back?

157
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:37,659
Speaker SPEAKER_05: Yes, hello, congratulations, Paul Rees from Al Jazeera English.

158
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,125
Speaker SPEAKER_05: Could you just give us a sense of where you were when you got the call, how it affected you?

159
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:47,991
Speaker SPEAKER_05: Is this a day you have in your diary just in case you get that call or is it a bolt from the blue?

160
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:51,435
Speaker SPEAKER_02: It was a bolt from the blue.

161
00:21:52,076 --> 00:22:00,586
Speaker SPEAKER_02: I'm in a cheap hotel in California that doesn't have an internet connection and doesn't have a very good phone connection.

162
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:06,070
Speaker SPEAKER_02: I was going to get an MRI scan today, but I think I'll have to cancel that.

163
00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:11,058
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Okay.

164
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:14,983
Speaker SPEAKER_09: This seems to be the last question from the press for you, Professor Hinton.

165
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:17,929
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Thank you.

166
00:22:18,189 --> 00:22:18,569
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Thank you.

167
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:21,134
Speaker SPEAKER_09: And once again, our warmest congratulations.

168
00:22:21,193 --> 00:22:27,142
Speaker SPEAKER_09: We look forward to see you here in Stockholm in December for the Nobel prize ceremony.

169
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:29,645
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Thank you.

170
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:32,567
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Okay.

171
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:44,986
Speaker SPEAKER_09: So let's move on to more questions about the physics prize and the research involved, or if you want to ask the committee members questions about their work.

172
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:48,490
Speaker SPEAKER_09: And again, questions are welcome in either English or Swedish.

173
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:54,839
Speaker SPEAKER_08: Please.

174
00:22:55,748 --> 00:23:04,204
Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yes, if these two scientists wouldn't have existed, would we have like GPT then?

175
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,336
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Professor Mons, do you want to address that?

176
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,269
Speaker SPEAKER_01: That's a very difficult question to answer because it's hard to imagine.

177
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:23,866
Speaker SPEAKER_01: They have contributed, of course, enormously very early in the progress of this technology.

178
00:23:24,387 --> 00:23:31,762
Speaker SPEAKER_01: So, in the 80s, these first steps were taken.

179
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:50,240
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Later on, other scientists have built upon these developments, so in a sense it may have been difficult without those groundbreaking first discoveries and inventions.

180
00:23:50,271 --> 00:24:03,498
Speaker SPEAKER_04: I'm thinking since John J. Hopfield is not here, I was wondering a little bit about what makes you most, what do you think is the most exciting part of his discoveries?

181
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:05,923
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Professor Ibeck, do you want to address that?

182
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:11,232
Speaker SPEAKER_10: When it comes to his network, he was

183
00:24:12,682 --> 00:24:28,128
Speaker SPEAKER_10: Parts of it had been discussed earlier, but he was able to put pieces together to create a network with a clear function and clear principles for how it worked.

184
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:31,955
Speaker SPEAKER_10: And it meant a lot in the field.

185
00:24:38,837 --> 00:24:40,480
Speaker SPEAKER_09: One more question here.

186
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:40,961
Speaker SPEAKER_04: Oh, sorry.

187
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:41,301
Speaker SPEAKER_04: Yes.

188
00:24:41,461 --> 00:24:47,632
Speaker SPEAKER_04: I also wonder about the worries that Jeffrey Hinton expressed.

189
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:51,679
Speaker SPEAKER_04: What are your worries about this technology?

190
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,023
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Professor Mons, you want to address?

191
00:24:56,371 --> 00:25:14,666
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Well, these type of worries are expressed a lot and discussed in the scientific community... ...and I think it is very good that they are discussed and it contributes to the knowledge about machine learning in the society.

192
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:26,619
Speaker SPEAKER_01: I think it's important that as many people as possible... learn about the mechanisms of machine learning... so that it's not just in the hands of a few individuals.

193
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:37,310
Speaker SPEAKER_01: So, I think, of course, Professor Hinton is one of many... who express their views on this.

194
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:44,298
Speaker SPEAKER_01: And, yeah, I think that's very good.

195
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:59,451
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Maybe I can add that there are of course many discoveries and inventions over the time that has been potentially possible to misuse, but it's sort of a common responsibility for a society to have regulations to avoid that to happen.

196
00:25:59,813 --> 00:26:03,839
Speaker SPEAKER_09: And I think that would apply too when it comes to artificial intelligence.

197
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:13,963
Speaker SPEAKER_09: I think that is it actually.

198
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:15,186
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Time is running out.

199
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:20,299
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Thank you for your interest in participating in this press conference.

200
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,912
Speaker SPEAKER_09: We hope to see you again here tomorrow when we will present the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

201
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:26,115
Speaker SPEAKER_09: Thank you.
