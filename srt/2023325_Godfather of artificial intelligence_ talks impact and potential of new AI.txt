1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,716
Speaker SPEAKER_00: This week, Google jumped into the AI arms race with the launch of BARD.

2
00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:10,564
Speaker SPEAKER_00: The chatbot will compete with OpenAI's ChatGBT, which is funded by Microsoft.

3
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:21,038
Speaker SPEAKER_00: In a few short months, these chatbots have wowed users with the ability to answer complicated questions, draft emails and speeches, plan custom vacations, and much more.

4
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:29,228
Speaker SPEAKER_00: But as it improves, this technology offers immense promise and significant, some say, existential danger.

5
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:36,719
Speaker SPEAKER_00: Brooke Silva Braga traveled to Toronto, one of AI's leading research hubs, to meet some of the people building this brave new world.

6
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:43,604
Speaker SPEAKER_04: So yeah, so this is an experimental preview of a chatbot we've been working on powered by our generative language model.

7
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:44,466
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Okay.

8
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:47,228
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Nick Frost is a co-founder of Cohere.

9
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:56,841
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Like Google and OpenAI, the Toronto startup has trained massively powerful computers on trillions of words and asked them to talk back.

10
00:00:57,201 --> 00:01:00,564
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Can it write, call it a book report.

11
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:02,366
Speaker SPEAKER_02: about War and Peace.

12
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:03,848
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Okay, it can.

13
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:07,733
Speaker SPEAKER_02: War and Peace is a historical novel by Russian author Leo Tolstoy.

14
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:15,281
Speaker SPEAKER_02: In a major leap for computing, these models can understand and create natural language.

15
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:15,981
Speaker SPEAKER_02: It just wrote this.

16
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:18,525
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but it's based on all the stuff that it's seen.

17
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:21,628
Speaker SPEAKER_02: The tech had been in research labs for years.

18
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:26,834
Speaker SPEAKER_02: ChatGPT's release last fall... Cheese, oh cheese, so luscious and bold.

19
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,016
Speaker SPEAKER_02: ...brought it to an unprepared public.

20
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:31,278
Speaker SPEAKER_02: It's writing me a poem about cheese.

21
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,801
Speaker SPEAKER_04: And it's pretty good!

22
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:37,987
Speaker SPEAKER_04: In the old school programming, we would write code to tell a computer what to do.

23
00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:39,069
Speaker SPEAKER_04: We still do that.

24
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:39,930
Speaker SPEAKER_04: Lots of people still do that.

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,337
Speaker SPEAKER_04: But another thing we do now is we write code to tell a computer how to learn what to do.

26
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:48,742
Speaker SPEAKER_04: And the way it learns is being shown many examples of what it should do.

27
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:57,632
Speaker SPEAKER_04: So in the context of large language models, the way that works is we get a huge amount of text and then we show it a few words and we get it to predict the next word.

28
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:02,158
Speaker SPEAKER_04: This simple technique turns out to give you something very useful and very powerful.

29
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:11,608
Speaker SPEAKER_02: So powerful that OpenAI's new GPT-4 does better on the bar exam than 90% of aspiring lawyers.

30
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:19,215
Speaker SPEAKER_02: These models write computer code in seconds and churn out blog posts on any topic that AI programmers haven't banned.

31
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:23,057
Speaker SPEAKER_02: They're becoming the newest arbiters of what ideas are out of bounds.

32
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:26,700
Speaker SPEAKER_02: And while chat apps are the current rage, other forms of AI.

33
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:30,283
Speaker SPEAKER_04: Now you can generate a video with nothing but words.

34
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:31,945
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Will do much, much more.

35
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:35,268
Speaker SPEAKER_02: This is the biggest technological advancement since.

36
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:40,633
Speaker SPEAKER_05: I think it's comparable in scale with the industrial revolution or electricity.

37
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:41,489
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Electricity.

38
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:42,195
Speaker SPEAKER_05: Or maybe the wheel.

39
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,598
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Or maybe the wheel.

40
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:46,326
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

41
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:50,633
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Jeffrey Hinton is known as a godfather of artificial intelligence.

42
00:02:50,653 --> 00:03:01,931
Speaker SPEAKER_02: For the last 10 years, he's helped Google create AI and mentor the industry's rising stars, including OpenAI's chief scientist, Ilya Siskova, and Nick Frost over at Cohere.

43
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:12,408
Speaker SPEAKER_02: In fact, Toronto is a global AI hub today in large part because Hinton moved here 40 years ago when the Canadian government agreed to fund his unusual research.

44
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:15,633
Speaker SPEAKER_05: I was kind of weird because I did this stuff everybody else thought was nonsense.

45
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:24,283
Speaker SPEAKER_02: While others pursuing AI tried to program logic and reasoning into computers, Hinton thought it was better to have them figure things out themselves.

46
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:26,687
Speaker SPEAKER_02: The idea was to mimic the brain.

47
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:34,616
Speaker SPEAKER_02: With lots of practice, these virtual neural networks, illustrated here, would make the right connections to solve a given task.

48
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,901
Speaker SPEAKER_02: there were doubters.

49
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:43,090
Speaker SPEAKER_05: The big issue was, could you expect a big neural network that learns by just changing the strengths of the connections?

50
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,919
Speaker SPEAKER_05: Could you expect that to just look at data and with no kind of innate prior knowledge, learn how to do things?

51
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:53,743
Speaker SPEAKER_05: People in mainstream AI thought that was completely ridiculous.

52
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:55,164
Speaker SPEAKER_05: It sounds a little ridiculous.

53
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,709
Speaker SPEAKER_05: It is a little ridiculous, but it works.

54
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:01,092
Speaker SPEAKER_02: It's all the real.

55
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:08,764
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Only in the last decade or so have computers been powerful enough to prove Hinton was right.

56
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:15,073
Speaker SPEAKER_02: His machine learning ideas applied to different kinds of training data now create all kinds of outputs.

57
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:19,619
Speaker SPEAKER_02: This, of course, isn't Tom Cruise, but a deepfake impersonating him.

58
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:22,802
Speaker SPEAKER_04: I went down to the office because they were making a robot of me.

59
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:29,291
Speaker SPEAKER_02: This isn't Andy Warhol's voice in the recent Netflix documentary, but a clone generated by Resemble AI.

60
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:31,915
Speaker SPEAKER_02: click record, and then read the sentence out loud.

61
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:40,529
Speaker SPEAKER_02: After a few minutes reading training text, Founder Zohab Ahmed had cloned my voice too.

62
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,317
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Habitat for Humanity, which helps homeowners build homes alongside volunteers.

63
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:47,279
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I definitely hear myself in there.

64
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:48,682
Speaker SPEAKER_02: smile into the camera.

65
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:53,028
Speaker SPEAKER_02: A company called Synthesia had me read a script in front of a green screen.

66
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:55,973
Speaker SPEAKER_02: They used that video to create this digital version of me.

67
00:04:56,473 --> 00:05:01,040
Speaker SPEAKER_02: We paired it with Resemble's voice to create a TV reporter who will say anything you type.

68
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:04,644
Speaker SPEAKER_02: The technology will only get better in the years ahead.

69
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:08,771
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Using this tech to spread misinformation seems inevitable.

70
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,394
Speaker SPEAKER_02: This is my very first day in Xinguan's agency.

71
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:18,144
Speaker SPEAKER_02: using it to replace journalists and lawyers and accountants and radiologists and novelists and songwriters and painters.

72
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:19,826
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Well, that could happen too.

73
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:21,750
Speaker SPEAKER_02: But it's going to take a whole ton of jobs.

74
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:29,079
Speaker SPEAKER_04: I think it's going to make a whole lot of jobs easier and a whole lot of jobs faster.

75
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,754
Speaker SPEAKER_02: I hear your answer in two ways.

76
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:33,738
Speaker SPEAKER_02: One, wow, it's great if it turns out that way.

77
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:42,014
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Two, maybe it's a little scary if the people making this technology haven't come to graps with the potential downfall of what it could do.

78
00:05:42,435 --> 00:05:47,305
Speaker SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think we try our best to think about what the true impact of this technology is.

79
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:52,468
Speaker SPEAKER_02: And the true impact of these advancements is the subject of a high-stakes debate right now.

80
00:05:53,129 --> 00:06:00,581
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Will AI quickly zoom past human abilities and become what's thought of as Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI?

81
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:05,387
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Last month, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman wrote, the risks could be extraordinary.

82
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:10,896
Speaker SPEAKER_02: A misaligned, super-intelligent AGI could cause grievous harm to the world.

83
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:15,021
Speaker SPEAKER_02: But Frost, and others, say Terminator-style worries are overblown.

84
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:20,348
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Large language models are just algorithms that write some smart-sounding words.

85
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:23,192
Speaker SPEAKER_02: They don't understand even basic truths.

86
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:24,434
Speaker SPEAKER_02: What day is it?

87
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:25,274
Speaker SPEAKER_02: It's Monday.

88
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:26,036
Speaker SPEAKER_02: It's Monday.

89
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:26,697
Speaker SPEAKER_04: It just guessed?

90
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:27,497
Speaker SPEAKER_04: It just guessed, yeah.

91
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,204
Speaker SPEAKER_04: I don't think the technology we're building today naturally leads to artificial general intelligence.

92
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,187
Speaker SPEAKER_04: I don't think we're close to that.

93
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,490
Speaker SPEAKER_05: His mentor used to agree.

94
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:43,641
Speaker SPEAKER_05: Until quite recently I thought it was going to be like 20 to 50 years before we had general purpose AI.

95
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,767
Speaker SPEAKER_05: Now I think it may be 20 years or less.

96
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,971
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Some people think it could be like five.

97
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,476
Speaker SPEAKER_05: I wouldn't completely rule that possibility out now.

98
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:54,281
Speaker SPEAKER_05: Whereas a few years ago I would have said no way.

99
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:57,726
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Are we close to the computers coming up with their own ideas for improving themselves?

100
00:06:58,067 --> 00:06:58,747
Speaker SPEAKER_05: Yes, we might be.

101
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:00,829
Speaker SPEAKER_02: And then it could just go fast.

102
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,232
Speaker SPEAKER_05: That's an issue, right.

103
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,855
Speaker SPEAKER_05: We have to think hard about how to control that.

104
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:05,454
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

105
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,016
Speaker SPEAKER_05: Can we?

106
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:06,916
Speaker SPEAKER_05: We don't know.

107
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:08,519
Speaker SPEAKER_05: We haven't been there yet, but we can try.

108
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:09,519
Speaker SPEAKER_02: OK.

109
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,880
Speaker SPEAKER_02: That seems kind of concerning.

110
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:12,442
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Yes.

111
00:07:13,384 --> 00:07:17,468
Speaker SPEAKER_02: What do you think the chances are of AI just wiping out humanity?

112
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:19,271
Speaker SPEAKER_05: It's not inconceivable.

113
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,112
Speaker SPEAKER_02: OK.

114
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,432
Speaker SPEAKER_02: That's all I'll say.

115
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:29,910
Speaker SPEAKER_02: How, Hinton wonders, will we manage a technology that could give a handful of companies or governments such awesome power?

116
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:36,399
Speaker SPEAKER_05: And so I think it's very reasonable for people to be worrying about those issues now, even though it's not going to happen in the next year or two.

117
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:39,302
Speaker SPEAKER_05: People should be thinking about those issues.

118
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:45,312
Speaker SPEAKER_02: For CBS Saturday Morning, still writing his own script for now, Brooke Silva-Braga, Toronto.

119
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:48,252
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Good for you, Brooke.

120
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,012
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, right.

121
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:52,538
Speaker SPEAKER_01: But two questions, like, why are you building it, one?

122
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:56,463
Speaker SPEAKER_01: And two, why aren't you thinking about the possible impact?

123
00:07:56,543 --> 00:08:01,872
Speaker SPEAKER_01: It's this big question mark, and the rest of us have to deal with it.

124
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,214
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Building it to try to make life easier.

125
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:12,649
Speaker SPEAKER_03: I thought the bigger question was, when Brooke asked, what do you think of the possibility of AI wiping out humanity, and the guy says, it's not... Not inconceivable, yeah.

126
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:13,947
Speaker SPEAKER_00: I would agree.

127
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,327
Speaker SPEAKER_00: My point exactly.

128
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:17,255
Speaker SPEAKER_00: I don't think we can answer that in 10 seconds.
